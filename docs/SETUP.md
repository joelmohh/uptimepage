# Setup Instructions
After installing the project, follow these steps to configure the application.

> If you don’t have it installed yet, go to [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).


1. Create an admin user
Access the API or database and create the first user with the same credentials you defined in your `.env` file:
```.env
AUTH_USER=
AUTH_PASS=
```

This user will be used to get the access token, see here [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)
